   John Blair &amp; Co. is close to an agreement to sell its TV station advertising representation operation and program production unit to an investor group led by James H. Rosenfield, a former CBS Inc. executive, industry sources said. 

   Industry sources put the value of the proposed acquisition at more than $100 million. 
John Blair was acquired last year by Reliance Capital Group Inc., which has been divesting itself of John Blair's major assets. 
John Blair represents about 130 local television stations in the placement of national and other advertising. 

   Mr. Rosenfield stepped down as a senior executive vice president of CBS Broadcasting in December 1985 under a CBS early retirement program. 
Neither Mr. Rosenfield nor officials of John Blair could be reached for comment.

   Stanley Interiors Corp. said it expects its first-quarter net income to be about the same as the $286,000, or 14 cents a share, posted a year earlier. 

   The maker of furniture and fabrics said it earlier expected first-quarter net to exceed the year-ago profit, but snowstorms in January and February forced the company to close some manufacturing facilities for as long as six days. 
The closings reduced operating profit, but that was substantially offset by reduced interest expenses, the company said. 

   Stanley said it doesn't anticipate a permanent loss of sales because of the closings. 
Substantially all the delayed shipments should be made in the second quarter, the company said.

   Yankee Cos. said it expects to post a $1.5 million loss from discontinued operations, possibly in its third quarter ending March 31. 

   The anticipated loss will stem from plans of a subsidiary, Eskey Inc., to sell the assets and business of its Yale E. Key Inc. unit to a group of that company's managers and a private investor for about $15.5 million. 
Yale E. Key is a well-service concern. 

   In the year-ago third quarter, Yankee had net income of $762,000, or 12 cents a primary share, on revenue of $51.6 million. 
Earnings included a $615,000 write-down of an investment. 

   Yankee, an energy and financial services concern, said the sale is part of its plan to focus on its core businesses and reduce its total indebtedness. 
The company expects the sale to be completed later this month, but said it still requires a definitive agreement.
